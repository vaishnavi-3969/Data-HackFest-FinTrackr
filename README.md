<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>
Managing personal finances is a fundamental aspect of an individual's life, and it can often become overwhelming to keep track of expenses, income, and financial goals. In a world where digital transactions and financial complexities are increasing, there's a growing need for a comprehensive and user-friendly solution that helps individuals take control of their finances, make informed financial decisions, and plan for their future effectively.

Our challenge is to create a web application that empowers users to manage their personal finances efficiently. The application should provide users with tools to:

Expense Tracking: Easily record and categorize expenses, income, and transactions.

Financial Overview: Offer a clear overview of the user's financial status, including account balances, spending trends, and income sources.

Budgeting: Enable users to set budgets and financial goals, providing them with real-time progress updates.

Bank Account Integration: Integrate with banking services (e.g., Plaid) to securely link and retrieve bank account information, transaction history, and balances.

User Authentication: Implement secure user authentication (e.g., Auth0) to safeguard financial data.

Data Visualization: Use charts and graphs to present financial data in an easily digestible format, helping users make informed decisions.

Customization: Allow users to customize categories, labels, and financial goals to suit their unique financial situation.

Reports and Analysis: Provide users with detailed reports and analysis of their financial history and trends.

Alerts and Reminders: Implement a notification system to alert users about upcoming bills, financial milestones, or budget overruns.

User-Friendly Interface: Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive interface that makes financial management accessible to users of all backgrounds.

By addressing these challenges, we aim to create a personal finance tracker that empowers users to take control of their financial well-being, make informed financial decisions, and ultimately work towards achieving their financial goals. This tool should cater to both financial novices looking for basic expense tracking and advanced users in need of comprehensive financial insights.
